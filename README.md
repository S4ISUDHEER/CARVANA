CARVANA 
What I Did:
In this project, I developed a machine learning algorithm to predict whether used cars listed in Carvana’s inventory were "bad buys" or "good buys". The dataset, consisting of 72,983 cars, contained 34 descriptive features that detailed various aspects of the cars, such as their make, model, condition, and more. The goal was to predict whether a car would be a bad buy (defective) or a good buy based on the provided features.
Key steps I took:
1.	Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
o	I examined the dataset of 72,983 cars and handled missing values.
o	I performed feature engineering, including normalizing variables (e.g., kilometers driven) and creating dummy variables for categorical features (like fuel type).
2.	Data Partitioning:
o	I split the data into training, validation, and testing sets, ensuring that the model had enough data to learn from while also being evaluated for generalizability.
3.	Model Development:
o	Using scikit-learn, I developed and trained a machine learning model to predict "bad buy" status for 48,707 additional cars (where the target variable was missing).
o	I applied various classification techniques, including decision trees and random forests, to find the most efficient model.
4.	Model Evaluation:
o	I evaluated the model using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine its effectiveness at identifying bad buys.
Problem:
Carvana, an online platform for buying and selling used cars, faced the challenge of identifying potentially defective vehicles from their inventory. They wanted to predict which cars in their stock would be "bad buys", based on 34 descriptive features, so they could inform customers about the quality of the vehicle and improve sales accuracy.
•	The dataset of 72,983 cars had 34 descriptive features, with cars classified as good or bad based on their defect severity.
•	The problem was to predict bad buy status for an additional 48,707 cars, where the defect labels were missing.


Insights:
1.	Feature Importance:
o	Certain features (e.g., mileage, age of the car, previous accident history) had a stronger impact on predicting whether a car would be a bad buy.
o	After training the model, I observed that mileage and age were among the most significant factors influencing a car's defect likelihood.
2.	Model Performance:
o	The classification model achieved a high accuracy, but precision and recall were balanced to ensure we minimized both false positives (incorrectly classifying a good car as bad) and false negatives (missing a bad car).
o	Random Forests performed particularly well, handling the dataset's imbalanced classes (fewer bad buys than good buys).
3.	Handling Missing Data:
o	The missing labels for the 48,707 cars were predicted using the trained model, and the predictions allowed us to identify which cars in the inventory were likely to be bad buys.
 
Recommendations:
1.	Improvement in Data Quality:
o	I recommend improving the data collection process to ensure that more complete information is available for each car, which would improve model accuracy.
2.	Continuous Monitoring and Retraining:
o	As Carvana’s inventory evolves, the model should be retrained periodically with new data to maintain its accuracy and ensure it adapts to changes in vehicle characteristics and market trends.
3.	Use of Model in Real-Time:
o	The developed model could be deployed to automatically flag cars that might be bad buys as they enter the inventory, improving the overall customer experience and minimizing potential defects in sales.
4.	Integration of Customer Feedback:
o	Integrating customer feedback on car quality could be a useful feature to enhance the model over time. As users report defects or provide reviews, this data could be incorporated into the model to improve its predictions.
